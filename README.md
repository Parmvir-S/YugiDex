## Purpose

YugiDex is a web application that allows users to browse and search for information about different Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. The app serves as a Yu-Gi-Oh! equivalent of the Pokemon Pokedex, providing users with a way to look up any Yu-Gi-Oh! card they want and save it to their personal list. Users can also view all available Yu-Gi-Oh! cards on one of the app's pages. YugiDex was built using React, React Bootstrap, and Firebase as a way to learn how to use these technologies together and explore the capabilities of React and Firebase.

## Motivation

The main motivation behind the development of YugiDex was to learn how to use React and Firebase in a web application and gain experience with these technologies. The project provided an opportunity to experiment with building a web application that utilizes the features and capabilities of React and Firebase, while also creating a useful tool for fans of the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise.

## Tech Stack

YugiDex was built using the following technologies:

-   React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
-   React Bootstrap: A front-end framework that combines the power of React with the popular Bootstrap framework
-   Firebase: A cloud-based platform for building web and mobile applications that provides a real-time database, authentication, and hosting services

## Features

YugiDex includes the following features:

-   Yu-Gi-Oh! card search: Users can search for specific Yu-Gi-Oh! cards by name or number to view detailed information about each card.
-   Yu-Gi-Oh! card list: Users can browse a list of all available Yu-Gi-Oh! cards and view basic information about each one.
-   Personal card list: Users can save their favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! cards to their own personal list for easy access.
-   Responsive design: The app is optimized for use on both desktop computers and mobile devices,

## Challenges

One issue that I encountered while building YugiDex is the challenge of integrating React and Firebase. Ensuring that the two technologies work together smoothly can be a complex process, especially for those who are new to either or both of them.

## Future Improvements

There are a number of things that could be done to improve YugiDex in the future. Some potential improvements include:

-   Implementing additional security measures to ensure that the app remains secure and protected from attacks
-   Optimizing the performance and scalability of the app by improving/changing the database and backend infrastructure
-   Adding support for multiple languages to make the app more accessible to a wider audience.
- Adding the ability to create multiple decks and switch between them.
